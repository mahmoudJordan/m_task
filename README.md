# My Web App

Welcome to My Web App! This is a simple web application that fetches data from an fillText API and displays it in a card format.

## Usage

To run the application without any issues you have to use a web server to serve it, or you can use a node package called http-server which is a development light-weight web server used to serve web apps in development environments

please follow these steps to install and use http-server:

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from the official Node.js website: https://nodejs.org

2. Open your terminal or command prompt.

3. Install the `http-server` package globally using npm (Node Package Manager) by running the following command:

   npm install http-server -g

4. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.

5. Start the web app using `http-server` with the desired port number (e.g., 8000). Run the following command:

  http-server . -p 8000

6. Once the server is running, open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:8000` (replace `8000` with the port number you used in the previous step).

7. You should now see the web app running, and you can interact with it to filter and display the fetched data.

Note: If you encounter any issues or have questions, please refer to the documentation of the `http-server` package or Node.js for further assistance.

Enjoy using My Web App!
